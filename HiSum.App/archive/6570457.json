No one makes decisions on who to HIRE based on a resume. The point of a resume is to get an INTERVIEW. Your resume could actually lack any details of the normal stuff that goes on one (education, experience, skills, etc) - but as long as what you provide gets you that interview then it&#x27;s done its job. As someone who&#x27;s done interviewing at interactive agencies, if I saw this I&#x27;d probably set up an interview.</p><p>The second is your assumption about the purpose of a resume&#x27;s design. Your thinking lies all on the company&#x27;s side - making things easier for the recruiter and facilitating understanding of the reader; allow me to offer an alternate line of thinking.
